Simple automounter consisting of shell scripts, using inotifywait.


- Put the files in /usr/local/sbin
- Set a cron to run /usr/local/sbin/automounter.sh to run every 10 seconds.
  This will initiate the watchers for the mount directories defined in automount-*.sh
- For convenience, use a limited tmpfs for /mnt/auto to prevent large stuff written
  to the root parition if something goes wrong. Add this to /etc/fstab :
  tmpfs   /mnt/auto    tmpfs   size=5M,noexec,nodev,nosuid,mode=0755  0       0
