Helper scripts for fscrypt, to be able to lock/unlock several directories at once.

See the fscrypt project at https://github.com/google/fscrypt

This tool assumes using custom passphrases, for they work without problems across the entire system.
This isn't the case for login passphrases, that still has some ocassional nasty bugs.

Install:

- place fsc-unlock.sh and fsc-lock.sh in /usr/local/sbin as root
- optional: for convinience, make symlinks without the .sh extension:
  ln -s fsc-lock.sh /usr/local/sbin/fsc-lock
  ln -s fsc-unlock.sh /usr/local/sbin/fsc-unlock
- create directory /usr/local/etc/fsc
- place a user configuration in /usr/local/etc/fsc/$username.sh
  use user-conf-example.sh from the project as an example
- make this config file readonly:
  chown root:root /usr/local/etc/fsc/username.sh ; chmod 600 /usr/local/etc/fsc/username.sh

If this is done, you can use:

fsc-unlock username

to unlock directories, and

fsc-lock username

to lock them.

Beware, for the fsc-lock command, also the user will be terminated, thus killing all processes of mentioned user.
